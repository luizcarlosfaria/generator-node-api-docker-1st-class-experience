> NodeJS + Typescript + TSLint + Restify + MongoDB + Docker, With VS Code Automation = VSCode TypeScript Live Debug with Containers

## Installation

First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and generator-node-api-docker-1st-class-experience using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

```bash
npm install -g yo generator-node-api-docker-1st-class-experience
```

## Then generate your new project:

1. Create a new folder.

2. Run ```yo node-api-docker-1st-class-experience```

3. Open VSCode `code .`

4. Put a breakpoint at line 21 of ./src/server.ts 

5. Just press F5 key (The first launch task uses docker to debug, you have other two options to debug in launch dropdown)

## The 1st class experience with NodeJS, Typescript, Docker

 * A NodeJS API with TypeScript, TSLint, Restify, MongoDB.
 * Using VSCode you will be able to:
    * Use VSCode to debug TypeScript based NodeJS application locally (using `Local debug` debug configuration).
    * Use VSCode to build and debug the TypeScript based NodeJS application behind the docker container with Docker Compose (using `Docker debug` debug configuration).
    * Use VSCode to build and debug with live reload of the TypeScript based NodeJS application behind the docker container with Docker Compose (using `[docker] build-and-watch` VSCode task and `Docker + watch debug` debug configuration).
 * With docker you will be able to:
    * v3 based docker-compose.yml.
    * The build is two-phase based, to get packages separately of application build.
    * Execute `docker-compose up` command to create a production ready deployment.
    * MongoDB container will be created side-by-side with your aplication, automatically, secured by authentication.
 * VSCode Integration
    * 3 debug options.
    * 5 VSCode tasks (including build task) to perform all necessary operations to manage, debug and build with docker.
    * TSLint with autofix enabled on VSCode and Build.
    * Use status-bar-tasks [Status Bar Tasks VSCode plugin][status-bar-tasks-url]  to see all tasks on status bar or use `Tasks: Run Task` with pressing `Ctrl+p >`
 
## Notes
* Local build will run in 2 seconds.
* First docker build is a full build and will during 3 minutes or more (depending on your connection speed).
* Every next build will run in seconds (
* Only changes in below files will demand a full build:
  * `package-lock.json`
  * `package.json`
  * `tsconfig.json`
  * `tslint.json`
  * `typings.json`
